# PASS_MAX_DAYS setting in /etc/login.defs
# The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the password is older
# than this, a password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be
# assumed (which disables the restriction).

# PASS_MIN_DAYS setting in /etc/login.defs
# The minimum number of days allowed between password changes. Any password
# changes attempted sooner than this will be rejected. If not specified, -1
# will be assumed (which disables the restriction).

# The user file-creation mask is set to mode. If mode begins with a digit, it
# is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise it is interpreted as a
# symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by chmod(1). If mode is omitted,
# the current value of the mask is printed. The -S option causes the mask to
# be printed in symbolic form; the default output is an octal number. If the
# -p option is supplied, and mode is omitted, the output is in a form that may
# be reused as input. The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully
# changed or if no mode argument was supplied, and false otherwise
